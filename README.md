# GitHub Reactions
A collection of GIF animations that you can happily use when reviewing code, commenting on Pull-Requests, or just in the occasional e-mail.

## Why?
GitHub recently added their own Reactions emojies that can be set on PRs and Issues, but while a good addition, there's never a replacement to a good and funny GIF that brings you from wtf -> lol.

When you want to show your appreciation for a Pull Request, would you rather reply with a thumb up emoji like this:

Or would you rather want to see a heart warming sincere appreciation like this:
